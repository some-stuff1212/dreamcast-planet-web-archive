dreamcast planetweb archive

Downloaded from archive.org using Wayback Downloader and this command :

wayback_machine_downloader http://dreamcast.planetweb.com:80/ --to 20100206165740 --all

This command should have downloaded all archive files from the earliest archive up to 20100206 (the last good archive I could find). Theres alot of stuff here that I just didn't have time to mess with. Gif, graphics, reviews and some software. I did see a few VMS files in there but unfortunately most has been lost.
